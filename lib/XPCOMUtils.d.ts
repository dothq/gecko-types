    /**
     * Defines a proxy which acts as a lazy object getter that can be passed

     * that object gets accessed.
     *
     * The evaluation can be triggered by a function call, by getting or
     * setting a property, calling this as a constructor, or enumerating
     * the properties of this object (e.g. during an iteration).
     *
     * Please note that, even after evaluated, the object given to you
     * remains being the proxy object (which forwards everything to the
     * real object). This is important to correctly use these objects
     * in pairs of add+remove listeners, for example.
     * If your use case requires access to the direct object, you can
     * get it through the untrap callback.
     *
     * @param aObject
     *        The object to define the lazy getter on.
     *
     *        You can pass null to aObject if you just want to get this
     *        proxy through the return value.
     *
     * @param aName
     *        The name of the getter to define on aObject.
     *
     * @param aInitFuncOrResource
     *        A function or a module that defines what this object actually
     *        should be when it gets evaluated. This will only ever be called once.
     *
     *        Short-hand: If you pass a string to this parameter, it will be treated
     *        as the URI of a module to be imported, and aName will be used as
     *        the symbol to retrieve from the module.
     *
     * @param aStubProperties
     *        In this parameter, you can provide an object which contains
     *        properties from the original object that, when accessed, will still
     *        prevent the entire object from being evaluated.
     *
     *        These can be copies or simplified versions of the original properties.
     *
     *        One example is to provide an alternative QueryInterface implementation
     *        to avoid the entire object from being evaluated when it's added as an
     *        observer (as addObserver calls object.QueryInterface(Ci.nsIObserver)).
     *
     *        Once the object has been evaluated, the properties from the real
     *        object will be used instead of the ones provided here.
     *
     * @param aUntrapCallback
     *        A function that gets called once when the object has just been evaluated.
     *        You can use this to do some work (e.g. setting properties) that you need
     *        to do on this object but that can wait until it gets evaluated.
     *
     *        Another use case for this is to use during code development to log when
     *        this object gets evaluated, to make sure you're not accidentally triggering
     *        it earlier than expected.
